## Basic Facade Use Cases

These use cases cover the basic manipulation of the *façade* (in which tests
there is no actual comparing or merging being done) as well as simple
compare/merge scenarios.  All tests are based on the UML representation
of the **J2EE Façade Model**, using the **J2EE Profile** on classes and interfaces.

### Use case a1

### Use case a2
